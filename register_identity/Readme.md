Used to register identity. 

To generate main.nr and test for it (as prover.toml too), use scripts from js folder.

process_passport.js requres const passportFile = "tmp.json" with passport info, which can be fetced using scaner on mobile app for example. Other are helper scripts.

To generate circuits without dg1, use doc repo (http://github.com/rarimo/passport-zk-circuits-noir-docs).
